I am a second-year PhD candidate in the joint program in Economics and Finance at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the Wisconsin School of Business. I graduated from Amherst College in 2019 magna cum laude with a B.A. in Economics and Mathematics. Before moving to Madison, I worked as a research analyst in the Capital Markets function at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
